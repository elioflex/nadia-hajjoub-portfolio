# Contact Form Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Changes Made (Just Now)

1. **Added `action="/"` to the form tag** - Required for Netlify Forms with JavaScript
2. **Added `bot-field` to JavaScript submission** - Ensures proper spam protection

## 🔍 How to Verify the Form is Working

### Step 1: Check Netlify Dashboard
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Select your site: **nadia-hajjoub-portfolio**
3. Click on **Forms** in the left sidebar
4. You should see a form named **"contact"** listed there

### Step 2: Verify Form Detection
If you DON'T see the form in the dashboard:
- Netlify hasn't detected the form during build
- You need to trigger a new deployment

### Step 3: Deploy the Latest Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix contact form for Netlify"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment
- Go to your Netlify dashboard → **Deploys**
- Wait for the new deploy to finish (usually 1-2 minutes)
- Look for "Deploy succeeded" message

### Step 5: Test the Form Again
1. Visit your live site: https://nadia-hajjoub.netlify.app
2. Scroll to the contact section
3. Fill out the form with test data
4. Submit the form
5. You should see: "Merci pour votre message ! Je vous répondrai bientôt."

### Step 6: Check Form Submissions
1. Go back to Netlify Dashboard → **Forms**
2. Click on the **"contact"** form
3. You should see your test submission listed

## 📧 Enable Email Notifications

To receive emails when someone submits the form:

1. In Netlify Dashboard → **Forms** → Click on "contact" form
2. Click **"Form notifications"** tab
3. Click **"Add notification"**
4. Select **"Email notification"**
5. Enter your email: **nadia95046@gmail.com**
6. Choose event: **"New form submission"**
7. Save

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Form not appearing in Netlify Dashboard
**Solution:** The form must be in the HTML during build time. Redeploy after making changes.

### Issue: Form submits but no data appears
**Solution:** Check that `form-name="contact"` matches in both HTML and JavaScript.

### Issue: Getting 404 error on submission
**Solution:** Ensure `action="/"` is in the form tag and you're submitting to the root path.

### Issue: Spam submissions
**Solution:** The honeypot field (`bot-field`) should filter most spam. You can also enable reCAPTCHA in Netlify settings.

3. **Form detection:** Happens during build/deploy, not runtime
4. **Changes require redeployment:** Any form changes need a new deploy to take effect
